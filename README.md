Trash Image Classification AI Model

Welcome to the Trash Image Classification AI Model project! This project aims to develop an AI model that can identify different types of trash in images, including plastic, paper, metal, glass, and compost. By training a deep learning model, we can create a tool that helps in automatic classification of waste, which can be beneficial for recycling and waste management efforts.

How It Works
The image classification AI model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn and classify different types of trash items. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Dataset Preparation: We use a labeled dataset containing images of various trash items categorized into different classes such as plastic, paper, metal, glass, and compost.

Model Training: The CNN model is trained on this dataset using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. During training, the model learns to extract features from the images and associate them with the corresponding trash categories.

Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate set of images to assess its accuracy and performance in classifying trash items.

Inference: Once trained and evaluated, the model can be used for inference. Given a new image containing a piece of trash, the model can predict the class or category to which it belongs.

Installation
To set up the Trash Image Classification AI Model on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trash-image-classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd trash-image-classification
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installation, you can use the Trash Image Classification AI Model as follows:

Training the Model:

Prepare your dataset of trash images categorized into classes (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, glass, compost).
Use the provided scripts or notebooks to train the model on your dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model using test images to assess its accuracy and performance.
Inference:

Use the trained model to classify new images of trash items. You can either use the provided scripts or integrate the model into your own applications.
Example Script:

bash
Copy code
python classify_trash.py --image path/to/your/trash_image.jpg
This command will output the predicted class of the trash item in the provided image.
